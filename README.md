This multiscale modeling tool will enable concurrent coupling between CPU and GPU solvers.

The demo cases are using LAMMPS as the CPU solver, and USERMESO-2.5 as the CPU solver. However, the multiscale modeling tools and corresponding algorithms developed in the demo cases are readily applied to concurrent coupling of other CPU and GPU solvers.
